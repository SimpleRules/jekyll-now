## Why quotes?

I keep quotes on this page because 

1. Sometimes when I need them, I forget the *exact* words. So this acts as reminder.
2. From time to time, I read them to derive new wisdom just like how some people like to read their favorite passages from their religious texts
3. Putting these here gives you an impression of who I am as a person.
4. Quotes sometimes make very good simple rules.

Three rules to take note:

1. Occassionally I will insert my own comments below the quote.
2. My quotes have subheadings that are either by author (e.g. Bruce Lee) or by topic (Mastery)
3. I do not make stringent checks on the true authorship of the quotes. The wisdom the quotes give me are more important than the authorship.

### Bruce Lee

>Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.

> I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.

> A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.
 
> If you always put limit on everything you do, physical or anything else. It will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.

> Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them.

> I’m not in this world to live up to your expectations and you’re not in this world to live up to mine.

> If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you’ll never get it done.

> Ever since I was a child I have had this instinctive urge for expansion and growth. To me, the function and duty of a quality human being is the sincere and honest development of one’s potential.”

> To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities.

> Man, the living creature, the creating individual, is always more important than any established style or system.

> It’s not the daily increase but daily decrease. Hack away at the unessential.

> Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water my friend.

> Choose the positive. You have choice, you are master of your attitude, choose the positive, the constructive. Optimism is a faith that leads to success

> Don’t fear failure.  Not failure, but low aim, is the crime. In great attempts it is glorious even to fail.

> If you want to learn to swim jump into the water. On dry land no frame of mind is ever going to help you

> What you habitually think largely determines what you will ultimately become. - Bruce Lee

### John Wooden

> If you don’t have time to do it right, when will you have time to do it over?

> Things turn out best for the people who make the best of the way things turn out.

> Be more concerned with your character than with your reputation. Your character is what you really are while your reputation is merely what others think you are.

> Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do.

>If you're not making mistakes, then you're not doing anything. I'm positive that a doer makes mistakes.

*I think a better simple rule is make new mistakes*

> Talent is God given. Be humble. Fame is man-given. Be grateful. Conceit is self-given. Be careful.

> Never mistake activity for achievement.

*Activity != Productivity is another similar simple rule*

>Success comes from knowing that you did your best to become the best that you are capable of becoming.

### Donald Knuth

> Computers make very fast, very accurate mistakes. 

*I prefer to use the word "precise" over accurate in this case.*

> A bug in the code is worth two in the documentation.

> A fault tolerant system must report the faults even as it tolerates them.

> An algorithm must be seen to be believed.


### Universe

> Interdependence is a higher value than Independence - Stephen R Covey

### Mastery 

> What I cannot create, I do not understand. - Richard Feynman

> If I look over my life, every single step of maturing for me, every single one, has had the exact same common denominator, and that was accepting what was true over what I wished were true. — Julia Sweeney

### Sundardas

> Success is a function of strategy, just-in-time tactics, implementation, and feedback.

*The only thing I am certain of is that success is a multi-variate function. As for what those variables are, I cannot be certain.*

> Implement is digital. Thinking is analogue.

> I devote energy to just 2 things: when I am with patients and when I am doing something new.

> Humans like to **have** choices. They don't like to **make** choices.

> All great endeavours begin with strong emotions - Dr S

### Steve Jobs

> Focusing is about saying no.

### Tyler Cowen


> you’ll understand yourself better if, in a given moment, you can pretend to distance yourself from some of your immediate impressions of your day, and treat yourself like a piece of your writing which you set aside for a week so you could look at it fresh. from http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/01/how-to-seem-telepathic.html

> In today’s global economy here is what is scarce: 1. Quality land and natural resources 2. Intellectual property, or good ideas about what should be produced. 3. Quality labor with unique skills.

> It doesn’t matter how flexible the wage is in the more complex, less brute force jobs. A manual worker who just shows up at your door is probably not someone you want to hire unless it is already part of a preexisting business plan with broad buy-in from your enterprise and your creditors. The worker might say, “I’ll lower my wage demands by thirty percent!” or, “I’ll work for nothing!” It usually won’t matter. The sad reality is that many of these workers you don’t want at all, even if the business plan involves additional labor. Some workers simply aren’t worth the trouble unless the demand for extra labor is truly pressing. -- The Average is Over

> The quest for continual high-quality excitement is not conducive to casual down time together, which is the glue which binds relationships together in the longer run. -- http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/09/trudie_on_longd.html

> 1. There is always time to do more, most people, even the productive, have a day that is at least forty percent slack.

> 2. Do the most important things first in the day and don’t let anybody stop you.  Estimate “most important” using a zero discount rate.  Don’t make exceptions.  The hours from 7 to 12 are your time to build for the future before the world descends on you.

> 3. Some tasks (drawing up outlines?) expand or contract to fill the time you give them.  Shove all these into times when you are pressed to do something else very soon.

> 4. Each day stop writing just a bit before you have said everything you want to.  Better to approach your next writing day “hungry” than to feel “written out.”  Your biggest enemy is a day spent not writing, not a day spent writing too little.

> 5. Blogging builds up good work habits; the deadline is always “now.”

Rahul R. asks me if I would like to revise the list.  I’ll add these:

6. Don’t drink alcohol.  Don’t take drugs.

7. At any point in your life, do not be watching more than one television show on a regular basis.

8. Don’t feel you have to finish a book or movie if you don’t want to.  I cover that point at length in my book Discover Your Inner Economist.

The most likely explanation of the disparity between rhetoric and investing behavior is that many people, especially academics and commentators, simply are not used to making huge changes in their market position based on political events. Such adjustments would require a big shift in mental and emotional emphasis, which isn’t easy --- many people have a hard time switching careers or fields, even if it would improve their life prospects. In other words, often we live as bifurcated selves, with the beliefs side ruled by the normal level of intellectual honesty and the action side ruled by inertia. -- https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-01-11/trump-doomsayers-miss-a-money-making-opportunity


### Productivity

“If you don’t have a good system for storing bad ideas, you probably don’t have one for filing good ones, either.”
— David Allen

### Funny

> I’d drag my dick through broken glass for a mile just to hear that woman fart over a walkie-talkie. - Irish Saying

> When you sell your soul to the Devil, he prefers to collect his purchase on the installment plan. - Saying I saw in the Atlantic
