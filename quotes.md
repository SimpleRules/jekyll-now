## Why quotes?

I keep quotes on this page because 

1. Sometimes when I need them, I forget the *exact* words. So this acts as reminder.
2. From time to time, I read them to derive new wisdom just like how some people like to read their favorite passages from their religious texts
3. Putting these here gives you an impression of who I am as a person.
4. Quotes sometimes make very good simple rules.

Three rules to take note:

1. Occassionally I will insert my own comments below the quote.
2. My quotes have subheadings that are either by author (e.g. Bruce Lee) or by topic (Mastery)
3. I do not make stringent checks on the true authorship of the quotes. The wisdom the quotes give me are more important than the authorship.

### Bruce Lee

>Always be yourself, express yourself, have faith in yourself, do not go out and look for a successful personality and duplicate it.

> I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.

> If you love life, don’t waste time, for time is what life is made up of.


> A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at.

 
> If you always put limit on everything you do, physical or anything else. It will spread into your work and into your life. There are no limits. There are only plateaus, and you must not stay there, you must go beyond them.

> Mistakes are always forgivable, if one has the courage to admit them.


> I’m not in this world to live up to your expectations and you’re not in this world to live up to mine.

> If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you’ll never get it done.

 
> Ever since I was a child I have had this instinctive urge for expansion and growth. To me, the function and duty of a quality human being is the sincere and honest development of one’s potential.”

> To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities.

> Man, the living creature, the creating individual, is always more important than any established style or system.

> It’s not the daily increase but daily decrease. Hack away at the unessential.

 
> Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water my friend.

> Choose the positive. You have choice, you are master of your attitude, choose the positive, the constructive. Optimism is a faith that leads to success

> Don’t fear failure.  Not failure, but low aim, is the crime. In great attempts it is glorious even to fail.

> If you want to learn to swim jump into the water. On dry land no frame of mind is ever going to help you

> What you habitually think largely determines what you will ultimately become. - Bruce Lee

### Donald Knuth

> Computers make very fast, very accurate mistakes. 

*I prefer to use the word "precise" over accurate in this case.*

> A bug in the code is worth two in the documentation.

> A fault tolerant system must report the faults even as it tolerates them.

> An algorithm must be seen to be believed.

### Mastery 

> What I cannot create, I do not understand. - Richard Feynman

> If I look over my life, every single step of maturing for me, every single one, has had the exact same common denominator, and that was accepting what was true over what I wished were true. — Julia Sweeney

### Steve Jobs

> Focusing is about saying no.

### Funny

> I’d drag my dick through broken glass for a mile just to hear that woman fart over a walkie-talkie. - Irish Saying
