## Career

I’m currently working on three different b2b projects/products, at various stages of development and implementation:

1. A data reconciliation app, focused on making it dead simple for users to upload files and perform reconcilation between different text formats. Works best for PDF files.
2. A quotation conveyor-belt for telecomms **equipment** company to manage customers (which are telecomms companies) and vendors (of various types).
3. A production-warehousing-sales platform for manufacturers in kitchenware and have factories in China.

I am crazy about building business products that are IT-based and generate recurring revenue. (Not a fan of the term "passive income").

## Other interests

I'm currently writing 100 posts on this blog to hit the "organic spurt" in competency. 

Also learning how to snowboard in places like Furano.

As a result, my capacity for extra projects is extremely limited. I am putting more wood behind fewer arrows so to speak. 

This is hard as it is totally against my usual mode of being for the past 5 years.

(Accordingly, I’m not currently offering any assistance in any pursuits, or participation in networking events). In fact, as silly as it sounds, I am actually **reducing** the number of people I am spending time with and business opportunities I am pursuing despite my self-professed obsession about building business products.

In my free time, I currently pursue:

- Skiing
- Snow-boarding
- Writing (via this blog)
- Roller-blading
