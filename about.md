I want this blog to be the "Apple of ideas". 

That means, this blog will have ideas that are extremely well-designed, approachable, beautiful, insanely easy to understand, and insanely easy to use. Most importantly, they must be incredibly useful. **This is the quality I want to achieve with my writing here.**

**I am a businessman who can code.** The programmers I work with think I am good with business stuff. The sales people I collaborate with see me as a technical talent.

The ideas in this blog will be on what I am good at: **Successful Software Selling**. 

I will write a longer piece to elaborate what that is. In short, my idea of Successful Software Selling is:

> Successful Software Selling = Successful Software + Successful Selling

Technical people concentrate on the Software portion. Sales people concentrate on the Selling part. I want to do both in an **integrated and holistic** manner.

When you build a successful piece of software, it is easier to sell.

When you are good at selling, it is easier to feed your software development with revenue and valuable feedback.

Both pieces work in an interdependent manner that the purists (those purely writing software or purely selling) cannot fully address from their perspectives.

## Lists

I have a few lists. Having lists help you better understand who I am and where I come from.
