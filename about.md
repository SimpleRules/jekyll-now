I want this blog to be the "Apple of ideas". That means, this blog will have ideas that are extremely well-designed, approachable, beautiful, insanely easy to understand, and insanely easy to use. Most importantly, they must be incredibly useful. **This is the quality I want to achieve with my writing here.**

**I am a businessman who can code.** The programmers I work with think I am good with business stuff. The sales people I collaborate with see me as a technical talent.

So, the ideas in this blog will be on **Successful Software Selling**. I will write a longer piece to elaborate. In short, my idea of Successful Software Selling is:

$$ Successful Software Selling = Successful Software + Successful Selling $$

Technical people concentrate on the Software portion. Sales people concentrate on the Selling part. I intend to talk on the overlapping portion of the two from my perspective.

## Lists

I have a few lists. Having lists help you better understand who I am and where I come from. The first list is my list of favorite quotes.
