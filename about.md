I want this blog to be the "Apple of ideas". That means, ideas that are extremely well-designed.

What does that mean? That means ideas that are approachable, beautiful,  insanely easy to understand, and insanely easy to use. Most importantly, they must be incredibly useful.

Ideas in what field? I will start with just the one: Successfully selling successful software systems. Yes, you read that right. There are 2 successfuls in that line with of 5 words that start with s.

Successfully selling successful software systems (or 5S) is a field that immediately brings to mind many smaller and familiar areas: selling psychology, software development, project management, etc. 

I will also venture into areas that may, on first glance have nothing to do with either selling or software, but they do.

Let's get started.
