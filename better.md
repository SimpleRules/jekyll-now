Aiming to be good invites comparison

Because humans dun understand what's good without contrast

And the natural thing to do is to compare yourself against someone else.

You got a Toyota car. Your neighbor has a Mercedes Benz 


The natural antidote to keeping up with the joneses is not to simply not compare.


We are too weaned on the comparisons. We cannot simply do away with comparisons.

The key is to do smart comparisons.

## current state

American dream aim for the good things in life. Aim to be good.

I will persuade that a) aim good is not good b) even if u want to aim for good things, the approach is precisely not to aim for good.

Aim for good is bad because we often pick what we want to good at based on what other people tell us


Aim for good is bad because we often need to know what's good only thru comparison. And comparison sucks.

Let say say you aim to be good organically, 
Your approach is often wrong.

The overly good approach is you spend a lot thinking too much abt making the right first impression.

Aka the perfectionist so much that you got failure to launch

The delusionally good approach is you think u are doing good 

Then u not getting results. Then u dun think about maybe ur performance is not good enough


## better is better

Why is be better better?

Be better helps u find goals organically.
