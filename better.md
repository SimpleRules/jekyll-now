Aiming to be good invites comparison

Because humans dun understand what's good without contrast

And the natural thing to do is to compare yourself against someone else.

You got a Toyota car. Your neighbor has a Mercedes Benz 


The natural antidote to keeping up with the joneses is not to simply not compare.


We are too weaned on the comparisons. We cannot simply do away with comparisons.

The key is to do smart comparisons.

## current state

American dream aim for the good things in life. Aim to be good.

I will persuade that a) aim good is not good and b) even if u want to aim for good things, the approach is precisely not to aim for good.

Aim for good is bad because we often pick what we want to good at based on what other people tell us

Aim for good is bad because we often need to know what's good only thru comparison. And comparison sucks.

Let say say you aim to be good organically, 
Your approach is often wrong.

The overly good approach is you spend a lot thinking too much abt making the right first impression.

Aka the perfectionist so much that you got failure to launch

The delusionally good approach is you think u are doing good 

Then u not getting results. Then u dun think about maybe ur performance is not good enough

## better is better

Why is be better better?

### find goals organically
Be better helps u find goals organically. you dun just adopt goals to impress people or because your mother wants you to .

### be better combines process thinking with outcome thinking 
Be better, by definition, requires you to compare where you were to where you are currently and repeatedly 

It conforms to Peter Drucker's most famous idea: what gets measured gets managed.

Whereas being good or being awesome or being great is about outcome thinking only.

### being better forces clarity.

being better is about lines and being good is about dots

trying to be good is like dots.

1 dot -- good at xxx
anothe dot --- good at yyy

or

being better is like lines.

1 line 2 dots at both ends this good at xxx and *this* good at xxx


it forces you to clarify how good you want to be, how good you currently are, and how to get there.

### being better allows and even hints at long term thinking

Once again, about the lines and dots.

you know how sometimes people get so obsessed with their goals they abandon their health recklessly?

you can go from good to better in a straight line.
or curvy line
or exponential line
or log line
or s-curve

## how to get better

### Make new mistake

Agile / lean

### You don't know anything for sure

Our civilisation prizes confidence that it's almost a sin to admit ignorance.

### break it down

create intermediate check points

### create the no-lose situation

either you are right, or you learn something new which you can use it to create better plans and better projections
