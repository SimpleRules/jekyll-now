7. Survive First Before Thinking Of Growth

It’s a common wish of entrepreneurs and business owners to grow their company as rapidly as possible, but many forget that before that, having a strong survival strategy is more pressing.

Having undergone the wrath of financial hell, Knudstorp reveals that the goal of LEGO was first to survive, before even thinking of growing again.

“Many economies and many companies think that survival is intrinsically tied to growing, [but] we decided to hardly grow for 5 years while we were fixing the business. So in that way, you can say that it was somewhat like someone who wants to win the Olympics first going into intensive care because you’re really bleeding. And then you spend 3 years in rehab where you’re gaining fitness, and training [non-stop], but only after that, do you come out and try to compete on a global stage and see if you can actually win an Olympic gold medal.”

And survive, and later grow, LEGO did.

Example:

 - see pep guardiola in pep confidential book where he actually spends a lot of time training defense

What's the possible problem in this thought pattern?

Rare, but it happens that you are actually ready for offense but you are still in defense mode. so great opportunities pass u by. then what kills you is the slow bleeding of operating in old paradigms and then disruptive innovation kills
