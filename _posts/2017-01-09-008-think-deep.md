title: Think Deep. Not think hard.
---

What do I mean when I say think deeply.

I meant engage emotions

Thinking is like using muscles, some muscles must contract and have tension, and some must elongate and relax.

Thinking is very much like that. SOme parts you need to put in a lot of effort which is what i call thinking hard.

Some parts you need to relax and maybe even not think at all.
