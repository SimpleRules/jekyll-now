title: The day you became a better boss
---

to the left brain, there's a distinction between leader and manager and that's true.

however, i have never met a person who's 100% leader and zero manager.
Or vice versa.

So anybody in a leadership or management capacity is never a pure leader or pure manager.

He, or she, is a boss.

And there's only one thing that a boss can do 

give you a clear answer to the one question (inspired by eric barker in his barking up the wrong tree book, on grit and games)

"What's the one thing you can do today to make your life better tomorrow?"

The skill of a boss lies in being able to answer this question at the Goldilocks level.

Not too abstract and not too concrete. Not too broad. Not too narrow.
