title: desire is a skill
---

Tianwei talks about the highflyers he met in navy who consistently outperform their peers

I relate that to my 4th/5th trip to china where i am focused on making the fixed reader work and did make it work.

and the takeaway for me was focused attention and desire.

he pointed out that other people were also desirous of good results and equally clear about their targets.

yet why only these people outperform?

this leads me to an insight that desire is not a quality. not a noun.

it's a skill. it's like balancing on a tightrope.

## tightrope analogy
if you desire the end goal so much, never consider the ways it could fail (see defensive pessimism), then that is no good.

Not enough desire ==> not enough energy necessary to drive through obstacles.

That's not good either.

## constant renewal

having desire is not like wearing a blue shirt. you put it on and it's done.

having desire requires constant renewal. need to re-create the desire as well. 

keep the flames alive. just as desire gives energy, it also requires energy.

this is a skill.

## mismatch of ultimate and proximate goals

i couldn't feel energized by the desire to be rich until i connected it with the ability to go for learning trips.

rich == proximate goal
learning == ultimate goal

ultimate goal is largely subjective, non rational, non obvious, cannot be chosen (at least not at the conscious level) and therefore cannot be easily given up if at all

proximate goal is rational, obvious, socially more conventional, can be chosen (and therefore can be given up)
