title: doubt is a skill

1. when people say they are doubtful, listen carefully.

they actually harbor a different belief which they are not expressing.

A belief that contradicts another belief, so they cast doubt on that other belief on the surface.

But what they are really doing is attempt to communicate their first belief.

Somehow they cannot, because the other belief holds better evidence or sway.


2. when people doubt, they almost never doubt their own doubts.

If they don't at least try to doubt their own doubts, or hold that attitude, then they are not genuinely doubting.

### so what's a true doubt?

one that is NOT expressed as don't believe.

one that is expressed as I am not sure if that's possible or likely.

one that allows itself to be wrong and always holds that as a genuine possibility.
