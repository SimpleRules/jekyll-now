title: Ultimate tenets of knowing
---

be like Bruce Lee and start a school for thinkers that is like jeet kune do.

no style because any framework ultimately will bind

to fight with no styles restricting you
to think with no beliefs restricing your thoughts

Just like the art of war is seemingly teaching its students how to fight, actually Sun Tzu is really teaching them how to win. more accurately, how to arrive at winning.

not teaching students how to think. we teach them how to arrive at knowing.

to know without thinking
