title: breakthrough - what's my water? blindspot vs reflection in the mirror
---

Breakthrough requires a paradigm shifts. means discovering something completely new from the unknown unknowns and shift it to known knowns.

Examples: newtonian to relativistic

There are 2 ways an unknown unknown is hidden from you:

blindspot - you cannot literally see your blindspot directly

reflection in the window -- you look but you do not see

the difference

blindspot: something hidden in a spot that you literally cannot see it directly
reflection: something hidden in plain sight

### how do we bring the unknown unknowns into view?

since we identified two types of unknown unknowns, each has its own solution.

Since blindspots cannot be directly observed, they can only be indirectly brought into view by mirrors. The people around us are our best mirrors.

No matter how open-minded a person you think you are, i bet that there is feedback that are frequently levelled at you and you ignored them.

The answer to recognise the feedback about your blindspots lies in the next paraable.

Teacup empty ==> beginner's mind

After reading the parable, you need a psychological anchor. 

You can use props or a mantra like "come from nothing" "Be a beginner."

"Begin from nothing. Again."

the solution to recognise the reflection in the mirror i think lies in recognising that there is a *somthing there*. Just that you haven't found it. And that something is staring right in front of you.

Here's another parable to illustrate this point.

the question whenever i get stuck is "what's the water I am not seeing?"

What's my water?
