title: assumptions constraints of a 35 year old
---

Recently, I have joking referred to my conversion to amoral person.

I have declared myself abandoning all the honorable values held and taught in my secondary school days.

on the surface, what i apparently decided that the constraints were the values taught to me when young were things like sincerity, honor, right behavior.

the real constraints is actually to take these concepts and accept them at literal face value.

That is the true constraint. You can even call it the meta belief or the meta value.
