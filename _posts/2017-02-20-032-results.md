Be results-driven. Not results-dependent.

Results driven: I want these results.

I can tell you very clearly what these results look like.

Results dependent:

I got x results, so I am worthless

you cannot 100% avoid feelings due to results dependent.

## how to find the right balance.

The moment you are buoyed by the positive results you get, you are forever by the same token going to be upset by the negative results you inevitably will encounter.

### You re-create your definition of your results.

Bill Russell mark himself /100

### Your results tend to be more process-oriented

### Your results tend to be more dependent on efforts within your area of control

cite inner game of tennis -- the difference between influence and control

### your results need to be simple and easy to glance. Aka in one sheet.
