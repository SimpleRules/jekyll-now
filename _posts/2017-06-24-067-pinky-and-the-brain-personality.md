paul graham noticed in his Y combinator,

to be successful, you need to be both incredibly smart and incredibly determined and determination actually requires you to be ignorant in a certain way

the analogy is to be both pinky and the brain at the same time.

this is unsustainable because both are contradictory forces.

in order to do that, need the insight from the CRT and FRT where opposing forces actually reinforce each other at least not in the visible manner
