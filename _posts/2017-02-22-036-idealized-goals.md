title: idealized goal

useful resource: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idealization

inspired by: The point of idealized goals like “zero waste” is not to obtain an outcome (which is literally impossible), but to create momentum in a direction that is likely to lead to lots of informative failures.

1. either me and Tiago agree but we use different phrasing.
2. i understand him perfectly, so we actually disagree on the phrase "not to obtain an outcome" I prefer more like "it's a target to aim at"  and it's useful to use aim at this target to inspire new ideas and perspectives. "create momentum in a direction likely to lead to lots of informative failure" ==> is to actually aim for it and see where that takes you.

examples: 

 - win without fighting (in suntzu art of war 不战而胜)
 - one fight, everlasting victory (in suntzu art of war 一战而定)
 - anything inside the dao de jing
 

 how to use idealized goals wrongly:

 - see it solely as a goal
     + which leads to feeling like a failure when u dun reach the goal (inbox zero)
 - see it solely as a method
     + which leads to questions like "huh?"

how to use idealized goals correctly:

 - see it as a starting point for inspiration to come up with new methods and evaluate existing methods
