title: surface game vs inner game
---

examples:

suntzu art of war 
surface game: how to fight wars
inner game: how to win

you may argue that it's abt how to fight wars and then win them.

i will say that's the surface game. the inner game will then be how to win without even fighting at all.

sometimes the inner game can be decided by you as a form of strategy.

surface game: basketball is about two teams of 5 taking turns to attack the basket with a ball.

inner game: not allowing opponent time on the ball. reducing the distance between regaining the ball and then attacking the basket.

which in turn is basically the full court press


the difference between the surface game and inner game is a difference in perceptions
