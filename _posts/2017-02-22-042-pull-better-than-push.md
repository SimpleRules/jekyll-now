title: pull better than push for sales
---

in enterpreneurial thinking, divergent thinking is prized

an important assumption is left out.

you need to pair divergent thinking with pull-based emotional goals

an emotional goal is pull-based. there is no such thing as an emotional goal that is not pull-based. 

you cannot have divergent thinking with zero outcomes. you need to pair it with something very clear which is pull-based.

divergent thinking is push-based.

in sales, we sell outcomes.

Quote: sell holes not drills.

This emphasis on selling outcomes is pull-based. the talking of features is a surface game. the inner game is about satisfying the demands of the customers. 


The demands of the customers pull the necessary features/products/services out of the providers.

No feature/product/service can ever create/push customers to have demand that wasn't there.

In other words, customers do not like to be sold. They like to buy.

in other words, we sell outcomes that we know they already want. sometimes, even when they don't even realise it.
