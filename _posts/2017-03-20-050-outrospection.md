Not enough reflection == eric cartman

too much reflection == neurotic

2 axis
   

vertical = feedback from outside

horizontal = reflection

no feedback from outside + pure reflection= trapped in own thinking (possibly neurotic if done in a negative mood)
feedback from outside + no reflection = reactive
no feedback + no reflection = no man's land
feedback from outside + reflection  = outrospection

reflection must be done in a neutral or postive mood
