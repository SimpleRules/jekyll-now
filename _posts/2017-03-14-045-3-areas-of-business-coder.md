title: 3 areas of business coder
---

sort of inspired by analyst, actuarial, and trader from mark tier

computer thinking (actual programming, appreciation of the function, inputs, and outputs, etc)

the domain knowledge (how to run legal company, how to run warehousing, etc, i also group human psychology under this though it's probably just as suitable to be on its own separate category)

business maths (operating expenses, TOC, business model, etc)

4 kinds of learning tools/aims:

analysis (develop / learn simple rules and then doing the leg work to apply them to particular learning cases

ie
pattern thinking
checklist marking
)

systems mindset (this is to reduce costs in terms of time, energy, and focused attention and lost opportunities)

fingertip feel ( i need scientific evidence from neurology to prove the validity of fingertip feel... this is more of a aim than a tool )

actuarial (maths / probability thinking )
