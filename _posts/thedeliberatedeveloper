What's deliberate

It's about moving the needle (WHY?)

(HOW?)

It's about being highly intentional and also highly consistent between actions and beliefs.

You can be taking lots of actions but not acting them with the full embodiment of your soul and beliefs. That's not deliberate. That's being a zombie. 

Self-deceiving worker

You can have a lot of beliefs but not acting according to those beliefs you are also not being deliberate. That's being an impotent theory master. 

Ambitious inconsistency

You can have both aligned which means you are consistent but if both your beliefs and your actions are for aiming low, then that does not require being deliberate. Indeliberate consistency / staying in your comfort zone


When you are deliberate, your actions and beliefs are aligned and they point towards being comfortable with discomfort. They point to being better.

When you are here, the needle will move

meta

The deliberate developer evolves the ethos of deliberate practice into his work

The problem with the deliberate practice isn't about the practice or the getting out of your comfort zone deliberateness. it's also abt the deliberateness of choosing what to focus on practicing
