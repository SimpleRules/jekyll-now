What's schema thinking?

Basically it's a basic understanding of the business domain + basic understanding of database theory

What's an artifact of schema thinking?

You can build a conceptual ER schema

A conceptual ER schema states:

1. the entities
2. the fields expected of the entities
3. the relationships between the entities

Someone with basic database theory can create a valid conceptual ER schema

Only someone with a good understanding of the business will come up with the right and useful conceptual ER schema

A stranger with no understanding of the business domain cannot tell whether a ER schema is right or useful when it's done.

A person with only the understanding of basic database theory also cannot.

Only when the app is built to a certain extent for users to start using, that's when you start to discover the errors in the conceptual ER schema.
