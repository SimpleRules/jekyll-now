The best writing is both poetic and emotionally cut to the core.

LKY is like that

His no bullshit way of cutting to the heart of the matter plus his masterful command of the language makes him one of the best orators and Writers.

The school likes to teach poetry rather than cut to the core.

Why? Cause cut to the core is not a technique per se.

It requires courage not bravado
True wisdom self indulgent intelligence
