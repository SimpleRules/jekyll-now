title: Fitness is the criteria
---

A huge part of my attention is revolved around my career. I spent a lot of time thinking about what makes a good career. How to excel in a good career. A lot of my initial thinking was simply if you work hard, you will have a good career kind of thinking.

Now I realise the situation is actually more nuanced than that.

Today, I want to talk about what is an important first principle towards having a better career. In fact, this first principle is so useful, I suspect, that it may apply to other areas such as relationships as well.

## What is fit

Let me define fit in terms of career. A lot of startup blogs talk about product-market fit. There's even a concept of founder-market fit where a VC does not necessarily pick the person who **currently** has the best demo or is the most impressive candidate, but picks the person who has a distinct blend of enthusiasm, skillset, knowledge, network that makes the candidate uniquely qualified to tackle a particular market.

What it means is even if a candidate has very good ideas about the banking/finance industry, and has many years of experience working there, but the candidate himself has attributes that make him uniquely positioned to do very well in the hairdressing industry, as a VC, you back him in anything he tries in the hairdressing industry. Not the banking industry.

Fit can be person-career fit and job-career fit.
