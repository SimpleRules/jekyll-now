My recent teeets n comments in twitter and medium have talked about flipping cause and effect 

If a then b statements

Then I say what if u flip it? Whenever u see b, try to look for the a.

This leads me to think about the BBiT bootcamp

We start with effects then slowly figure out causes.

Then I recall how good vgr is at extrapolating cause to the nth order implication 

Use ncn to explain how vgr does it


So we have two very cool ways to give do deep analysis 

One backward one forward in terms of causal chain
