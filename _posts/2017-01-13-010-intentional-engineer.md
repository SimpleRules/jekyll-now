## Who is the Intentional Engineer?
The Intentional Engineer is not a who. It's a what. The Intentional Engineer is a mindset. A mindset about being **conscious** and **deliberate**.

Conscious of the mental maps they are operating in. Conscious of the choices made and their consequences. Conscious of resources they have and conscious of the desires they have always wanted.

Deliberate in being the cause of the matters they care about. Deliberate in owning the results of everything in their life even if the author is someone else. Deliberate not just about what to do, but also what **not** to do.

In other words, the Intentional Engineer is not someone and yet it can be anyone.

## So what does being an Intentional Engineer do for me?

The Intentional Engineer is a builder. They build systems and structures in their lives so that they can get new results or better results.

The first human to think for themselves, "Hey! Maybe I can keep all these chickens and cows so I can have a consistent food source instead of worrying about my food everyday " is an Intentional Engineer.
