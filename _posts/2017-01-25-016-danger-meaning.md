danger * drama = meaning

i know that doesnt make sense

this makes more sense to you

danger * drama = discomfort | growth | risk | excitement

how does that translate to meaning?

also there's a max amount of discomfort you can handle. 
max amount of risk you can handle at any one time.

so you need to think of danger * drama = meaning using the goals cap.

so you need to think of danger * drama = constant using the planning cap.
