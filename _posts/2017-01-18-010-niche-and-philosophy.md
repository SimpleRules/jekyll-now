title: Niche and philosophy
---

I have always been fascinated with philosophy as I used to see it (mistakenly) as some kind of secret cheat code to figure out life in this universe. That led me to [embrace Truth](/001-first-is-it-useful) as a core value.

I cannot find the exact quote from Paul Graham though I remember it was him. He said not to pursue philosophy but instead go after specialised fields and pursue [hard problems](http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html). Eventually, the hardest problems in any field turn out to be philosophical in nature.


MOst if not all blog advice is to go after niche topics.

which is why i am now going to remodel this blog to go after revenue as a software provider
