Write as 30 page book called squaring the circle

## Intro

When we say we want to be successful what we really want is a break through

We Want to be rich without putting in the years 

Etc

We say we want success. What we really want is a breakthrough.

And what is a breakthrough?

It's to square a circle.

Show evaporating cloud

Because this is my book I call it whatever I want

Ladies and gentlemen, I call this the conflict cloud.

## the only rule that matters

Let's be clear

Actually there are two rules because my lizard brain is acting up right now and I am giving in to it.

What I am about to say isone way it's not the way

Okay that's not really an important rule. It's just me covering my lizard brain trying to protect me. Making me cover my behind.

The real rule that I want you to know and the only thing that matters is:

You **only** need to care about **you** getting **your breakthrough**.

Focusing on my spelling is not helpful.

Focusing on whether your Friend is doing it correctly after you have a breakthrough with this method.

If you find 

You need to intelligently disobey this book. Not blindly obey. Not blindly **disobey**. Intelligently disobey.

If you get a breakthrough and you can live with the consequences, you don't have to answer to anyone. Definitely not me.

## the method

Once upon a time, Teo Psychologists Dos something no Psychologists in the history of psychology has ever done 

They won the Nobel prize of economics.

They squared the circle.

Most books are written appealing to the reader's System 1 or System 2.

So are most methods prescribed in these books.

I want to describe to you a method that prioritises the human inside of you by appealing to both your System 1 and System 2

## story and ude list

## form the core conflict cloud

## resolve the dilemma

### the Long and proper way
### the quick and dirty way

Use quotes 
Use who, where and when

## Example of me writing this book 

## Example of me using it for work

## Example of me using it for relationships


## List of practical dilemma 

Just do up all the cloud from my list

## potential pitfalls

Overly opinionated and reverse engineer

Overly focused on getting it right

Start by using it on ur actual issue 

Not aware of the black swan & unknown unknowns which can also be represented by your conflict cloud

## recommended sequence 

Now you are almost finished with this book and you want to try this out and get the real through you have been looking for your whole life.

What you are trying to do is introduce a new thinking habit a new pattern and that's not easy.

Sometimes you really don't want a solution. ur inner genius is going to reject it. 

If you accept a solution blindly, it's like admitting you are not smart enough and damn it you are good enough! If you are reading this right now, you figured out a way to get your hands on this book, so you are better off than half the people on this planet because x% of the word population cannot read at all.

Once again, I will help you square the circle. I will help you change the wiring of your brain while still your mind's natural instincts

I am going to show you the recommended sequence

Find a comic sequence 

Try out the Long and proper way using a comic way
Try out the Long and proper way and quick and dirty way for another dilemma 
Then purely a quick and dirty way on something u familiar with but u dun really care.
Then the Long and proper way on the thing u care about 

Let me explain why you need to try this at least 3 different times and take frequent breaks.

In case you are wondering yes I wrote this book with the full intention of it being informational and directive. Both a textbook and a workbook.
