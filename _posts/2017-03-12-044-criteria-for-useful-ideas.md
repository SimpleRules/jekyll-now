title: criteria for useful ideas
---

I admire shane parrish and what he did in farnam street, yet I couldn't quite put my finger about what's missing for me in the list of mental models.

then i read tyler cowen http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/01/how-to-seem-telepathic.html

and i decided that maybe I will define a criteria for useful ideas or useful mental maps

A useful mental map is one that realizes at least one of the following criteria

1. helps me personally in my life, relationships, and career
2. helps most humans almost immediately in life, relationships, and career  

  draw venn diagram between the two sets  

3. helps towards my personal quest for mastery 
4. helps towards my personal quest for performance

so one good idea is this mental trick to appear telepathic
