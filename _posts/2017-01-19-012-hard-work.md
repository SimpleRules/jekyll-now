title: Growth and hard work
---

Growth usually involves some *hard work*.

If it's easy *all the time*, you are not growing. Not growing is boring.

Does it mean to grow, you need to work hard *all the time*?

I made that mistake before and still do from time to time. Subconsciously, if things start to get easy, I self-sabotage by making subtle decisions to make things tough again. 

This is the martyr mentality. 

*See how hard I tried? Isn't my victory glorious precisely because I worked so hard? Even though I failed, I worked so hard in the process the outcome no longer matters?*

All this is for protecting the ego.

Don't get me wrong. I am all for working hard. There comes a point of diminishing returns. I have sacrificed many hours in pursuit of my projects.

But I also know I have used long hours at work to avoid the *hard work* of thinking what really needs to be done and what needs to be **not** done.

Setting aside time to think how to work smarter is the kind of *hard work* workaholics and martyrs avoid.

Here's a simple rule to remember when you are in the midst of the hard work. 

**If it's too hard, you're doing it wrong**

Another good simple rule is to set aside time on a daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly to reflect.

Final simple rule is to ask at the major checkpoints.

**is this activity or is this productivity?**
