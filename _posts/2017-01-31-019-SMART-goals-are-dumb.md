title: SMART goals are dumb
---

SMART goals are dumb. They work only for machines and highly mechanical tasks with predictable task-path.

When you choose a goal that has an unpredictable path, SMART is dumb.

WHen you choose a goal that has an unpredictable path, you need to find an emotional anchor to that goal you have selected.

**Note to self: I need to find research that supports this.**

That emotional anchor will re-energize you and remind you what it is that keeps you going forward when the going gets tough. As it inevitably does.

That emotional anchor (or reason) does not have to make any sense. It does have to be emotionally arousing. It works even better when the emotions aroused are of an intensity of 9/10 or even 10/10.

SO here's the formula:

arouses strong emotions fast.

arousing = arouses emotions fast (it either is or it isn't) (a must-have)
strong emotions = the intensity is at a level of 9 or 10 (almost a must-have)
