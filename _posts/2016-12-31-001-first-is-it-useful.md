title: First, is it useful?

I know you have no idea why you are reading this. You are probably thinking : 

*Who the hell is this guy telling me stuff? What's his credentials?*

Let's just say that I know a few things and hopefully you may be able to get a nugget or two from what I have to say. As long as you improve even 1% on your current results, it's worth sitting through what I have to say, right?

Before I begin, let me make a few assumptions about you. Because I care about you and you are a busy person. I am sure you don't want to spend time reading stuff that has no relevance to your life. If my assumptions about you are wrong, feel free to stop and let me know.

## Number 1, you are an ambitious person

For whatever reasons, you have noticed since young, you wanted to do more than what the rules say you are allowed to do. Be it from an authority figure, or from an instruction manual, you have always been curious and thought to yourself, "I wonder what happens when I press this button that they say should not be pressed." Even if well-meaning people give you reasons why the button should not be pressed, you then wonder 
whether the reasons they gave you are true. Partly because of this obsessive curiosity, you always want to push your limits.

Maybe you deny you are ambitious person. You recall instances where you lower your standards instead of stepping right up. You turn down opportunities staring at your face. That multi-millionaire offering you a chance to work on a spec work project. 

But you also recall instances where you went a little bit beyond than what was required. Your teacher asked for volunteers for science fair, and you built a freaking robot arm. Your boss at your holiday job asked you to do data entry, you went ahead and created a step-by-step instruction manual on how to do the data entry, so that the next guy who takes over from you can do just as good a job as you did. Even those times you turn down certain opportunities --- they did not meet your secret criteria for opportunities. 

You want success on your own terms, not other people's.

## Number 2, you value truth above almost everything else

If I were to do those standard personality tests where I asked you to prioritise things like money, success, love, intimacy, family, companionship, health, etc, I am pretty sure your top 3 would definitely have **truth** in it.

Of course, by truth, I don't mean honesty. Only the universe knows how often you have been less than honest because you don't want to hurt someone, get what you want, or simply just to be liked. By truth, I mean, you want to know how things really work.

That has of course led you to read volumes of non-fiction material about science. Which hasn't helped you much to get results in life because, after all, you are the ambitious type (See Number 1 above) and science is more about explaining how the physical universe is and not really about how to succeed in life. Success in life has more to do than having more information about the physical universe around us.

Truth is such a high value for you also because you see that it helps you get what you want. You see truth as an ultimate tool to get what you want more easily. When you get what you want more easily, you have achieved your ambitious goals.

## Number 3, which makes you a confused person when these two values collide

You are also smart. Because there have been times when you receive advice that does not seem to be easily verifiable to be true or false and yet sounds convincingly useful. 

You sort of have an intuition that maybe, just maybe, the advice is probably true but you are experiencing some kind of cognitive dissonace. And the reason for the cognitive dissonance is because you are actually *uncomfortable* with acting on the advice so you come up with excuses such as whether the advice is true or not. 

So what should you do? How should you choose?

Most people will give you what I call the **one-sided advice**. They either tell you to choose to stick to your values (only accept advice which is verifiable) or abandon them totally (Forget about having truth as a top value. Choose something else.)

Well, I am different from most people. I want you to continue holding your values and still **arrive at a different conclusion**. Don't worry. I am not going to force you to accept an argument that you are not willing to accept. I certainly won't make an argument that you believe to be totally false because, as I have noted, you accept truth to be a very important value in your life.

All I am asking from you is this, 

*if you accept my premises to be true, and you find my argument to be logical, and then the conclusions we have arrived at together, no matter how counterintuitive they seem, you will accept them.*

Fair enough? Good. Let's go.

## Sometimes, there are more than 2 truth values.

First premise: you make a very 2 dimensional, sweeping assumption about all the information in the world. They are either true or false.

Consider this: you make a prediction about tomorrow's weather in that it's going to rain. Now, if I want you to rate this prediction **right now**, how are you going to rate it? True? False? 

You will probably make some kind of weaselly answer such as: 

**If it rains tomorrow, then it's true. If there is no rain tomorrow, then it's false.**

If I hold a gun to your head and force you to either choose true or false for this prediction, do you think that's fair? Of course not.

*Wait*, you protest. 

*This is a prediction statement. Sooner or later when the time comes, this statement will collapse into either a true or false statement.*

Sure, but there are also other things that are un-knowable no matter how far into the future you go. 

## The unknowable 

Suppose you are deciding whether to choose a career in public speaking but only if you know in advance **for certain** whether you will be successful at it. 

You can see where I am going with this already.

How can you ever know **for certain in advance** whether a career choice is the right one for you? 

Sometimes, it's not even about your career. It can be a relationship, or an investment choice. Maybe even what activity to spend your weekend on.

And yet, our lives are populated with such decisions with imperfect information.

For completeness, let me lay out the argument in a formal way.

1. There is at least one instance where limiting to just *_true_ or _false_* as truth values to describe a piece of information is un-helpful. Not only un-helpful, but it goes against your deeply held value of knowing the truth.
2. In life, more often than not, we tend to make decisions with imperfect information.
3. Imperfect information usually cannot be reduced to just either *_true_ or _false_*.
4. Since another deeply held value you have is about being ambitious in life, 
5. **Conclusion: this requires you to develop multiple truth values or choose another criteria to evaluate information that you receive or better yet, you need to do both.**

Let me say that conclusion once again, to deal with imperfect information about the advice you get, you need to **develop beyond binary truth values and choose another criteria to evaluate the advice you receive**.

You know what's the best part about this conclusion? You can even apply this advice onto itself right after you are done reading this article!

## 2 simple rules to evaluate advice

1. Is the advice beyond basic binary truth values (true or false)?
 If yes, suspend your judgement about the correctness of the advice
2. Is the advice possibly useful?

For reasons of energy (which I will explain more in my future article on energy), I will say, "Prioritise the is-it-useful critera first". Just take my word for now.

In other words, the simplified version of the 2 simple rules to evaluate advice is

> First, is it useful? 

Try it. 

In fact, try it now on this very same advice. Is it useful?
