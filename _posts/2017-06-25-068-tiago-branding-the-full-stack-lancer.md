Yeah I get this, but it depends. I’ve presented what I do as Forte Labs for a long time, for this exact reason. Developed a whole brand with business cards, letter heads, etc. But now I’m noticing my own name carries more weight, and by hiding behind a corporate facade I’m actually dampening my earning power. I’m working on a rearchitecture now to put my name front and center.

Interesting. I think that’s fine. Only the best and brightest will attend my school of meta-skills. Like Hogwarts.
There’s a major drawback with domain-specific courses: they change so often, the material gets out of date in no time. Difficult to do sustainably, as you always have to be learning and updating your material. Meta-skills change much more slowly. They don’t map directly to specific tech interfaces or even features, so they have more longevity.
I think a big issue with teaching meta-skills has been the method of instruction. It’s been taught as a philosophical, abstract thing. I think it should be taught hands-on, using practical projects as examples. If we could change this, much more ppl would be interested and able to learn them.

1. need to educate the importance of meta skills
2. need to repackage the meta-skill to simply sound like a skill
3. need to have domain specific breadcrumbs that lead to the meta skill

e.g. thoughtworks https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/intelligent-bank-power-platform-thinking

is a combination of technique 2 and 3

e.g. they call their holistic approach of looking at technology and business and customer centric thinking as simply platform thinking which sounds and feels very concrete-y

they then start off by addressing the issue of traditional businesses failiing by picking a very specific domain: banks

and then after a series of 3 articles, they simply left another link to their meta skill: platform thinking
