Optimism as a form of thinking has several evolutionary benefits see Eric barker book

Pessimism also has evolutionary benefits particularly when it comes to seeing reality accurately and prediction.

Then talk about defensive pessimist and strategic optimist.

Are they the same? Are they different?

For the person seeking breakthrough, 
First I want to reject the use of optimism and pessimism as a state of mind. 

I want to confine them as explanatory style.

I want to create a brand new kind of thinking for the breakthrough human. Ambitiously realist.
