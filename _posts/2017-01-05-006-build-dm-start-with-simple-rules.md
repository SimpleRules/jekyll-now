title: Build DM? Start with Simple Rules

After trying to build DMs (Default Modes) since December, I have a slightly different take on DMs. 

Before I explained everything from A to Z, let me first give you the summary. After which, you can make a choice. You can either read the summary and stop there. Or you can read more after that.

It took me some time to refine my thoughts because, well, after a course like SM you want to change everything and anything.

Which is natural.

Right now, with about 80% confidence, I can say that the DM I am building towards is this:

```
1. Make execution easy (or easier)
2. Make understanding deep (or intuitive)
```

I may still change my intention about building this DM in the future, but the chances are more likely I will keep working on this.

If you want the full explanation, please continue. Else you can stop right here.

## DMs are expressed as Simple Rules

The first thing I realise is that DMs are **expressed** as a set of Simple Rules. Sometimes they are just a set of 1 rule. Whether a DM is expressed as 1 rule or several rules, it doesn't matter. I am just saying Simple Rules are the **building blocks** of **expressing** a DM.

Notice I repeat the word **express** and highlighting it.

The reason is I don't know what a DM is actually made of. But everybody is good at something. And in your area of expertise, if I ask you for your recipe for excellence (in other words the DM you use), you will inevitably express it in a small list of Simple Rules. 

Anybody can memorise and recite a recipe. It doesn't mean you can cook that dish. If you can cook a dish, you definitely can give me a recipe of some kind if I ask you for it.

## So what does all this mean?

What this means, is if I want to build a new DM, these are the steps:

1. Define a set of Simple Rules
2. Execute them
3. Execute them regularly
4. Execute them well

Each step builds on the previous. In every step there's also a substep: review, reflect, and change the rules or the execution.

Building a new DM takes energy. Energy is limited every day. You may have DMs to be good at your day to day but they still require some energy (in other words, not zero) and at the end you don't have much energy left to build new DM.

So how to build a DM despite our every day busy lives?

## 2 DM building strategies 

To generate the energy needed to create new DMs, there are basically 2 strategies:

1. Improve the efficiency of the good DMs you already have ( so you have more energy left at the end of the day )
2. Create new DMs with an investor mindset (basically start by building DMs that refill the tanks faster)


### Example of Strategy 1: Improve Current DMs

I average working 10 hours a day (I know I need to work less, ha!). And I am pretty good at my job (you just have to take my word for it, double ha!), so I do have some good DMs.

Improved efficiency means I need to have the same results while **leaving more energy at the end of the day**. I need to look through all the various DMs I used in a day and see if I can get more done or done faster.

Turns out i cannot make any of my current DM any more efficient(at least not immediately). But some of them are not time sensitive, so what I do is I build this new Simple Rule

```
Start work 1 hour earlier and end 1 hour earlier
```

Mind you, that didn't immediately work. My success rate for the above Simple Rule is 1 in every 10 days,  I manage to start and end work earlier than usual. 

After a month of trying, I am now 2 in every 10 days successful.

Here's the weird thing even though I effectively work the same hours, I feel more rejuvenated. I don't know why. I get (slightly) more done and that's a mark of efficiency.

So what do I do with the extra time and energy I freed up? I use it to *think*. Specifically, *think* about what new DMs to build.

In other words, tank-filling DMs. When you do this, you are having an investor mindset to build DM.

### Examples of Strategy 2: Invest in Energy-Restoring DMs

I build other tank-filling DM such as 

1. sleep 7.5hrs
2. ignoring facebook
3. unsubscribe from stuff I no longer read or watch, and 
4. schedule one meet-up a month with friends. 

The list goes on. 

More accurately, I started with Simple Rules. Rules about what to do (sleep 7.5 hrs) and what **not** to do (no facebook!). Whether or not I execute them, that is an issue for the second step. If I find it too hard to execute, then I refine the rules until **something is executed in the right direction, no matter how small**.

## What other DMs you have built?

When you create a set of Simple Rules, it doesn't mean you have a DM. At best, I now have 3 different DMs ranging between 5%-25% becoming full DM.

Recall I wrote earlier that, *Simple Rules are how a DM is expressed*. If you have stated a set of Simple Rule, that's just the starting point. Until you are well-practiced in **executing** them, they are not DM. Maybe, just M.

Recall I wrote 

1. Define a set of Simple Rules
2. Execute them
3. Execute them regularly
4. Execute them well

You probably need to get to step 4 to call it a DM. Chances are, you need to run through all 4 steps a few cycles of iteration because you are **unlikely** to get it right the first try on each step.

So isn't this a long piece of thing to remember? I thought so too. Which brings me to a very specific insight. A question. And that question is:

```
What if I create a DM that helps me build DMs?
```

Yes. That's the sound of your mind blown.

Let me say that again in a different way, how do I express a set of Simple Rules that remind me to fill my tanks, create new DMs, avoid getting stuck on DMs that are used in the wrong context, and all that other stuff?

That boils down to :

```
1. Make execution easy (or easier)
2. Make understanding deep (or intuitive)
```

Let's start with **Make Execution Easy**:

- If I recharge my tanks, execution (in a day to day sense) becomes easy (or easier).
- If I build new DMs and have more options, execution becomes easy (or easier).
- If I improve the efficiency of my current DMs, execution becomes easy (or easier).
- If I make the rules easier to execute, execution becomes easy (or easier).

and so on. You get the idea.

Now, let's try **Make Understanding Deep**:

- If I have a deep (or intuitive) understanding of myself and the concepts, I don't have to rely on working memory, then I can just execute using muscle memory.
- If I have a deep (or intuitive) understanding of myself and the concepts, I won't be confused, then I can just execute with no hesitation.
- If I have a deep (or intuitive) understanding of myself and the concepts, even when I am executing wrongly, I can correct myself fast because I am my own feedback loop

and so on. You get the idea.

So that's it. 

I feel good about this DM to make DMs (a meta-DM!). I have some results. Already I have updated the Doc on some minor wins. (E.g., I have a story about me using a checklist for out-processing an employee who resigned, but that's another story for another day.) 

If you are thinking whether you can do the same, yes, you can. Maybe the Simple Rules are the same, maybe they will be different -- it doesn't matter. Try. Experiment. Change.

My plan is that, I will have more success stories to share with the Doc and some of you in the future. I also have some screw-up stories, but hey, you cannot have the sweet without the sour.

In the meantime, be patient and be safe.
