software eating the world ==> what software practices/attitudes can be ported to the real world as well?

DRY

 1. rails because DRY

DRY ==> solve novel problems

TOC teaches us to look at constraints

Ruby on Rails also because of constraints:

hardware getting cheaper
developer not getting cheaper

constraint is developer time

Actually not just developer time, more like developer creative energy

quote the power of engagement fella

And yet because software eating the world, we need to think like developers


repeatable vs not repeatable
simple for machines to model vs hard for machines to model

and not just look at digitizing our tasks. Look at ourselves and our lives as machines that can be scripted or programmed.

the power of a mantra

DRY (plus the acknowledgement of developer energy) led to RoR and 37 signals


need a reason to bring in the both machine and developer analogy in

As humans living in an analog world about to be swallowed whole by software, we are both machine and developer at the same time. 


We need a slightly different mantra. As a developer and a person selling software, I am painfully aware that most people do not have the attitude of a developer. Saying "DRY" does not make sense to them. Yet the zeitgeist is that of fear. Fear that they will lose their livelihood. Fear of uncertainty, be it from globalisation or software driven automation.

We need a mantra to give to our fellow human beings: that allow them to build their own versions of RoR in their lives. To retake autonomy. 

So the new mantra has to be a modification of DRY. One that acknowledges the inevitable drive towards automation and also acknowledges the psyche of non-developer human minds.

I suggest Solve Novel Problems is the Don't Repeat Yourself principle for humans in the new software driven world.

The mantra works at several levels: the obvious one being that it's a restatement of the same DRY principle in different words

secondly, humans have been progressing precisely the inventors and pioneers amongst us tackle novel problems successfully.

3rdly, the mantra obeys basic messaging of "dont think of an elephant"

4thly, there is such a thing as meaningful repetition Using "Don't repeat yourself" can cause a kind of cognitive dissonance at worst. At best, it backfires because of sophistry.

Solve Novel problems sound obvious until you take a hard look at your own life and self.

Just like before RoR, people have been building webapps in a highly repeatable manner. We have gone through life with highly repeated tasks.

1. solving problems is enjoyable. it's success. achievement
2. the best chance of solving a problem is one which you solved before or at least familiar
3. in a sense, we are all dopamine driven addicts to solving problems for pleasure. even more so when we are well paid for it.
4. solving novel problems is hard because there's no map for the solution. and there are problems that are outright unsolvable
5. lastly, we have tendency to believe in our identities
6. This is why people find it hard to switch careers especially in the face of impending automation arriving to automate away their jobs
