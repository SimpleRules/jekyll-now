title: Deconstructing Tim Ferriss
---

Tim Ferriss is expert with deconstructing other worldclass performers.

My fave is the 17 questions he asked.

A lot of my work involves deconstruction of systems, pattern recognition, and assembly of the deconstruction back into new systems for my clients.

What if i do the same?

Then write about how i deconstructed every single one of his 17 questions.
