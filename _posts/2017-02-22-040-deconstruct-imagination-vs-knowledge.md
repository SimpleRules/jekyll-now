title: deconstruct imagination vs knowledge
---

einstein quote: imagination is more important than knowledge

deconstruct it

what you don't know more important than what you know aka possibility better than reality

imagination is pull-based. knowledge is push-based. aka pull is better than push

Another quote: you cannot solve the problem at the level you conceive it
