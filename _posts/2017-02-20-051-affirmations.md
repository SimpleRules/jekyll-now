1. use scott adams' way to experiment with daily affirmations
result = mixed

some got stuck for very long time due to non-action

some got abandoned due to bad selection of goals

2. added woop 

result = slightly better as forces me to clarify the next steps and obstacles
improve momentum 

some still get stuck for a very long time

3. what if I added next physical action?

prompt that points out the next obstacle or next action stuck too damn long

Getting Affirmations Done

Rules:
1. must be regular (preferably daily)
