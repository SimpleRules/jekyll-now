title: Learning how to change

Learning how to change is going to be the most important skill set.

One trick pony

Learning how to change is different from learning how to learn

Learning how to learn is abt changing ur knowledge n maybe ur mindset as well

Learning how to change is about changing ur knowledge perspective and behavior 

And if you have all 3 lined up your results in life should change as well.

In other words, learning how to change is learning how to learn **on steroids**
