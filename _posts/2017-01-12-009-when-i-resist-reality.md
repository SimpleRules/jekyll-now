title: What it looks like whenever I resist my reality
---

After a productive session with my mastermind (*waves* at Zell and Karen), I realised whenever I am in a particular state of mind that I will call **non-resistance**, I am happier, more at peace, and weirdly, get better results in my life.

Whenever I am in the opposite of that mental state (I called it the **resistance** state), it has a strange powerful hold on me. Almost hypnotic.

What I do is to create a public criteria of signs that indicate I am in the resistance state. That way, the people around me can point that out to me and I can stop resisting. 

It's like the first step in the 12-step alcoholic program. First step of relinquishing a trance-state is to be aware that I am in one.

So here are the signs I am in the **resistance** mental state.

## Signs I am in the resistance phase

1. **Whenever I am angry**
  Anger is always a strong emotion for me. A clear sign I am resisting something.
2. **Denying that I am angry when I am already angry**
  Denial is 
3. **Whenever I am worried and being vague what I am worried about**
  Worry can be useful. But not when it's done to excess and leading to paralysis. Which happens often. One way to break out of this is to state out clearly what I am worried about.
4. **Whenever I cannot give a clear description of what it looks like when I fail**
  This happens almost whenever I resist. I don't know what it looks like when I fail. And after I describe what failure looks like, I will then realise that, "Hey even if I *fail*, I learn new things"
5. **Whenever I cannot give a clear criteria of what it looks like when I succeed**
  This is similar to #4. Usually what happens is without setting a clear indication what success looks like, I will end up going sideways. Describing what failure looks like tells me when to stop trying. Describing what success looks like forces me to avoid half-assing my way waiting for miracles to happen.
6. **Not answering the question**
  Classic defense mechanism. I do it so well, sometimes I am not even aware of it. I should have been a lawyer. Ha!
7. **Not using the word I**
  Another of my classic defense mechanisms. Now I am at #7, I feel embarrassed. Ha! This happens often when I want to describe how I really feel, but to avoid being judged, I end up de-emphasising the pronoun I.
8. **Overemphasis on right-vs-wrong. Underemphasis on useful-vs-not-useful**
  Part of the [reason why I started this blog](/about) is to correct my tendency to harp on right and wrong. Whenever I get into right-vs-wrong arguments, I end up getting angry. Which is basically sign #1. Avoiding getting too much into right-vs-wrong judgements will hopefully pre-empty my descent into anger.

Well that's probably it. I will add more as time goes on. Definitely will be based on what my friends around me are telling me.

If you are not sure how I am resisting, but you definitely feel that **I am**. Just point it out and let me do the legwork of figuring out where I am resisting.
