Before we begin, two notes:

1. By default, when I use the pronoun "I", I meant it as Dr S.
2. If I insert **my own** comments, I will do it using quote blocks and end it with my name

2017, New Year. New Year typically means New Year Resolutions. I am going to be controversial and share with you not just my top five business lessons from the previous few years, but also something controversial.

My achivements for past few years are ... 

> The Doc goes on to elaborate his achievements. This is to establish his credentials and burnish them into the mind of his audience who are not all SP or SM grads

Here is my controversial opinion.

Goals are not enough. New Year Resolutions (NYR) are not enough to succeed. To succeed, you need to:

1. You must have strong emotions invested in the goals you choose (ie the goals must be meaningful to you)
2. You must plan to succeed
3. You must invest the time and allocate resources into your plan

## Important statistics

### New Year Resolutions (NYR)
> 88% of people fail their NYR -- Professor Richard Wiseman

I am going to say something heretical. Have you heard of [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) goals? 

SMART goals only work for mechanical beings and well-defined tasks. Like computers and machines. SMART goals **do not** work for organic beings like humans. 

Until and unless, you are emotionally invested in the goal, you are not going to accomplish the goal you set out.

So we need a plan. A very good plan to invest in goals.

### Leading Death Factors are behavioral in nature
75% of deaths are due to these 3 causes:

1. Obesity
2. Alcohol
3. Smoking

These 3 causes, in case you haven't noticed, are completely modifiable. They have to do with your lifestyle choices. 

### Marriage

2 million marriages in USA & 1 million end in divorces. That's half.

75% of those divorces caused by "lack of communications".

### Productivity

US companies lose 200-300 million dollars each year due to employee absenteeism, tardiness, and burnout.

## My own experiences

### Rigorous Experiments
Whenever I plan for a new startup, I typically spend 3 months to a year just running experiments.

Why? Because it's even more wasteful to just jump straight into a new business idea or venture without figuring out all the steps. Without figuring all the steps, you have a bad plan.

You need a good plan to have good energy & resource allocation. Doing that increases your chances of success.

### Time and busyness

When people tell you they have "no time" for something, they usually mean:

1. it's not a high value activity for them
2. they don't have the energy or the skills or the resources to accomplish it


## 2014-2016 Overview

I am going to use the following symbols:

`*` represents observations
`#` represents strategies or tactics
`<>` represents the results I got

`*`2014 was my highest revenue in over 20 years of business, BUT I did not even hit 70% of the goals I set for that year.

I panicked because I couldnt figure out why my revenue was so high that year. When something is not well understood, it is not reproducible

> I need to jump in here because for me, this was one of the biggest insights for me in SM 15. It's a completely counterintuitive insight. Usually people care more about the results (unexpected windfall? awesome!) than about the process.
> 
>I am constantly on the lookout for experts who are better than me and find out what they do and what they choose **not to do**  that are completely different from what I choose.
>
> This was one such key observation. 
>
> This lesson is not just applicable in business. Everytime you have an unexpected positive result that you cannot explain why, you should treat it as a warning signal to re-examine things. At a deeper level, I derive the principle that decision-making process matters more than results.
> 
> Why? Because results are not completely within your control. They are subject to many factors such as circumstances, luck, etc. Your decision-making process, on the other hand, is completely in your control. If you get your decision-making process spot-on, you can easily reproduce results in your life.

> One key insight leads me to develop a deeper principle. -- Kim

I then spent the next 3 days measuring my typical workday in **15 minute chunks**. I spent a high % in admin tasks.

`*` In fact, I needed 500 hours more to do everything required. That is 500 hours of my time, I do not have.

`<>` Out of this, I develop the following solutions :

- develop DMs in my thinking
- form teams
- outsource
- automate
- create systems
- develop protocols for long process activities such as hiring new staff, outsource tasks, etc
- develop new full time members to fill up gaps
- team retreat to bring everyone in the same wavelength

I also developed a special kind of "accounting".

I condensed all my key metrics into a single sheet of paper and then break it up into 3 horizons: daily, medium-term, and long term.

So at any one time, I will be able to glance at it and know where I stand in my business.

## Hiring dilemma

Most of you who run your own business understand this dilemma: 

Hire ==> costs go up
Don't hire ==> cannot exploit new oppotunities and increase profit and go to next level.

So here's the solution:

1. Hire 1 more new person
2. Have that new person be so good (or train) that your profits go up enough to have extra for you ...
3. .. to hire the next one and then repeat the cycle

This solution therefore requires you to have **very precise strategies and calculations**.

`<>` Results:

1. Hire more people in the past 3 years than I did in the previous 20+ years before
2. Started company retreat first time ever in 2014
3. Did Wealth Creation Blueprint ==> realized that I did not have the resources for it and then shelved it and worked on my resources.

## 2015

`*` Turnover went down

`#` I restructured my online team. I spent 4 months just to scope out the tasks.

`<>`
By sept 2015, I hit my highest monthly revenue ever in 27 years history (100,000)

Not every idea will work, but you need to test to know what works.

`#` One useful strategy I did was to develop resources for 1 company and then **reuse** for other companies.

E.g. the SEO team I developed for the naturopathy company I subsequently employ them for my events company as well.

## Case Study (Galactic)

Galactic is a annual 7-figure revenue precision engineering business in Malaysia and have been around for 15 years.

Yet when I ask the boss, can you tell me what's your expected revenue by year end, he cannot answer me.

They have:

 - no branding
 - inconsisten cash flows
 - boss working 12 hour days
 
 They hire us as consultants and took us 3 years and we got them:

 1. consistent cash flows
 2. more time for their families

## Royal Family Invite

This was a serendipitous opportunity. A speaker pulled out and I was asked to give a speech in Bali started by the Royal Family.

The criteria for the speaker is stringent. Need to have doctorate, years of experience and credibility, etc.

If I had not taken the time to build the systems that allow me the space, time, and resources to exploit this opportunity, it would not have happened.

## 5 Biggest Lessons

These are my 5 biggest lessons in business:

1. look at big picture
2. use experiences & intuition
3. go for big, juicy dreams
4. don't worry about "how" 
5. have a bigger vision for yourself ie it's not just about you

`#` Usually I have an issue with number 4 'cause it's a default pattern of mine to worry about the details and the "how"

## Energy

It's not about organising time. It's about organising your energy.

It's not about motivation either. Ever had a time when you had to go to the bathroom to pee? 

When you reach the bathroom, did you need someone to stand next to you and encourage you to pee? 

No, the situation lends its own energy via the urgency.

So what you do is you schedule all your routine work into your low energy periods and your creative work into your high energy periods.

Remember! You have a special bank account that gets credited 86,400 units a day at the start. Then it will get wiped out by the end of the day.

That's 86,400 seconds of your life. How do you want to exploit it?

## Freedom Formula

I developed Freedom Formula that :

1. works with your whole brain (and not just one side of your brain like SMART goals)
2. aligns people with processes
3. helps you focus on one page

## Despair Curve

This is how people change or fail to change successfully

![Despair Curve](/unlisted/images/despair-curve.png)

They hit the point of despair and they don't have enough resources to make the climb back as show in the second figure.

So what happens is that they often give up at the point of despair.

If you do this enough times, you are training your brain to give up .
