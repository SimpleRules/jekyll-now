I wrote down that I am supposed to update you guys on the outcome of me experimenting visualisation exercises and precise planning since 1 month ago.

Here's an update.

## Visualisation exercises

I have been working on 3 visualisation exercises and the best progress is on my physical fitness area. I improved in that area to the point where I have upped the numbers on my visualisation 3 times.

What also helps is that every Monday, I will print out a receipt from a weighing machine for the fitness goals. Same for the personal POSB bank account and the corporate OCBC bank account.

### How to improve 

I realised that I have oddly taken photos of the fitness receipts every week. I only keep the hardcopies only for the most recent copy.

What happens is that I get overly emotionally triggered of the fluctuations. I realise what I should have done is to capture the weekly numbers and create a moving average.

Going forward, I will create a moving average for all 5 stats.

## Precise planning

My Bali retreat back in December introduced me to the theme of being precise in my planning.

In that retreat, the instructor insists that if I cannot break down a plan into 15 min chunk, I don't really know how to do it.

That was a high standard but also thematically the same thing I am trying to teach my intern. It was sobering to realise that I need to learn the same lesson as my intern albeit at a different level.

I have been experimenting with different productivity tools. The latest one I am trying is todoist.

The fact that I even remembered to send this update to you guys is due to 

1. the standards I set for myself to be even more precise in my planning and execution
2. the time it took for me to make todoist work for me

Right now, with todoist, I am getting better at tracking *activity*. My ultimate goal is to maximise my creative process. My next KPI to be better at is *productivity*. I am still spending too much time (going by gut feel) on *unproductive* activities. That is the next checkpoint for me to clear.

Update you guys again in 3 months time.
